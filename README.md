# My Plant Saver Android Application

> *The intention behind open sourcing is two fold: First of all, to allow developers to contribute new ideas to the project. Second, serve as a code reference.*

# About project
My goal is to create an application that helps the user to care and water the plants. In this project I will use the **Jetpack Compose toolkit** for the first time. My aim is to deepen and learn the Jetpack Compose toolkit. The project is still under development, so many features are still missing. As I only work on it in my spare time, I am moving slowly.
